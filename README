These are my modifications to the Ethernet library for Arduino.

Modifications:
 * client.getRemoteIP(uint8_t sock, uint8_t *ip); - This allows you to get the clients IP address. (FINALLY!)
 * client.getSocket(); - This allows you to export your sockets from the EthernetClient class. (use Client(socket) to import)


To Install:
 Just replace the Ethernet/ folder in $arduinodir/libraries/Ethernet/ with the one in this folder.
 If you have any changes to your $arduinodir/libraries/Ethernet/ just merge the two, I so far have only modifyed:
    * Ethernet/utility/w5100.cpp
    * Ethernet/utiliyy/w5100.h
    * Ethernet/EthernetClient.cpp
    * Ethernet/EthernetClient.h
